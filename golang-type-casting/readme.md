The golang-type-casting branch from the golang-topics repository covers the following points:

Convert data types such as int, string, float64, and float32.

    Convert composite data types like arrays, slices, maps, and structs by individually converting each element, as they cannot be directly converted.
    
    Perform type assertions and use type switches to convert data from interfaces to fundamental data types, especially when the data type is unknown.
